// int strcoll ( string $str1 , string $str2 )

// strcoll — Locale based string comparison

// Note that this comparison is case sensitive, and unlike strcmp() this function is not binary safe.

// strcoll() uses the current locale for doing the comparisons. If the current locale is C or POSIX, this function is equivalent to strcmp().
